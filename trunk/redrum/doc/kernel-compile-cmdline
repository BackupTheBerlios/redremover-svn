# Some parts don't work, eg. because they're shared libraries, or get

make arch/x86/vdso/vclock_gettime.o arch/x86/vdso




Normally I try to compile with this line:
	ASM_SUBST_OPT="" \
		HOST_LOADLIBES="-L/usr/src/redrum -lredrum" \
		ASM_SUBST_DIR=/usr/src/redrum/ \
		make vmlinux -k -j3

and then take a look at individual problems via
	ASM_SUBST_OPT="-d -D"
		HOST_LOADLIBES="-L/usr/src/redrum -lredrum" \
		ASM_SUBST_DIR=/usr/src/redrum/ \
		make vmlinux
