Installation
------------

Please see the output of "make install"; this doesn't install per se, but 
gives a shell script fragment that might be used to create the necessary 
symlinks in /usr/bin.



Translated compilation
----------------------

Once the scripts are installed, the translation can be activated by setting 
the environment variable "ASM_SUBST_DIR" to the path of a directory with 
assembler files (with suffix ".s").

These files are read by the translation script, and when a matching 
assembler fragment is found, it is replaced by a jump to a labelled 
destination from the fragment.

Furthermore you can set these flags in the environment variable 
"ASM_SUBST_OPT":
   -M   don't do the assembler macro substitution via "as -alm"
   -d   debug information
   -D   write the input and output of the translation into "/tmp/as?-*.s".



How to get to such assembler fragments
--------------------------------------

In the src/ directory you can find the script "rr-analyse.pl", which allows 
to look at the disassembled output of binaries (by using "objdump"), and 
(by using the option "-o <directory>") automatically writes a list of 
suitable fragments into the given path.

Furthermore this can give a rough estimate of the bytes saved.



What now?
---------

There are a few loose ends; the translation doesn't always work, 
translation of conditional jumps has to be tested/fixed, and so on.

There's a TODO in the src/ directory.
