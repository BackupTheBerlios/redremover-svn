Asm Macros:
-----------

Macro expansion in the assembler isn't recogniced, so common expression 
that result from macro expansion are not compressed.

"as -ahls=filename" doesn't seem to really help.

Eg. with invalidate_interrupt* (arch/x86/kernel/entry_64.S:850) the macro 
expansion should be done before.



Jumps with adresses _init+0x4d
-----------------------------

Need a label generated, but how?
